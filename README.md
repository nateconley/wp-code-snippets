# WP Code Snippets

## Usage

Shortcode:
```[wp_code_snippets language="LANGUAGE"]YOUR CODE GOES HERE[/wp_code_snippets]```

View a list of supported languages [here](http://prismjs.com/#languages-list).

The shortcode **must** be wrapped in ```pre``` tag in TinyMCE (preformatted). This is so that TinyMCE respects spacing.

Unfortunately, you must use spaces, not tabs. Sorry, Richard Hendricks.

### Quirks
- The shortcode must be inside a ```<pre>``` tag. This is to maintain spacing.
