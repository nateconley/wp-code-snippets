# WP Code Snippets

## Usage

Shortcode:
```[wp_code_snippets language="LANGUAGE"]YOUR CODE GOES HERE[/wp_code_snippets]```

View a list of supported languages [here](http://prismjs.com/#languages-list).

The shortcode **must** be wrapped in ```pre``` tag in TinyMCE (preformatted). This is so that TinyMCE respects spacing.

There is a button in TinyMCE that opens a popup with improved editing.

You can find a settings page in ```Setting > WP Code Snippets```, where you can change the theme.

## Bonuses
WP Code Snippets is compatible with **Beaver Builder**. Just add a text editor module and click on our TinyMCE button.

You can highlight the shortcode and content within the TinyMCE Editor and click the ```</>``` button and it will populate with your code!

### Quirks
- The shortcode must be inside a ```<pre>``` tag. This is to maintain spacing.
